## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and a package manager like npm installed.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-media-automator.git
    cd social-media-automator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    # If using Vite
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

    # If using Create React App
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    *The application code expects `process.env.API_KEY`. Build tools like Vite and Create React App expose environment variables with specific prefixes (`VITE_` or `REACT_APP_`) to the frontend code.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on your local machine, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 💻 Usage

1.  Navigate to the application in your browser.
2.  Fill in the **Main Topic** for your content.
3.  Select the desired **Target Audience** and **Tone** from the dropdown menus.
4.  Under **Select Platforms & Formats**, enable the social media platforms you want to generate content for using the toggle switches.
5.  For each enabled platform, choose a specific content format from its dropdown list.
6.  Click the **"Generate Posts"** button.
7.  The AI-generated content will appear on the right-hand side, organized into cards for each platform.
8.  Use the **"Copy"** button on any card to copy the text to your clipboard.

## 🌐 Deployment

This is a static React application, making it easy to deploy. You can host it on any static site hosting service.

Popular choices include:
-   [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
-   [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
-   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-   [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

Simply connect your GitHub repository to one of these services and configure it to build and deploy your application. **Crucially, you must set up your `API_KEY` as an environment variable in your hosting provider's settings.**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Help! I deployed my app, but all I see is a blank page.

This is a common issue. Here are the steps to debug it:

1.  **Check the API Key**: The most common cause is a missing API key.
    -   This application will show an error screen if the API key is not configured.
    -   Go to your hosting provider's dashboard (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
    -   Find the "Environment Variables" section for your project.
    -   Ensure you have a variable named `VITE_API_KEY` (or the equivalent for your build tool) set to your correct Google Gemini API Key.
    -   You may need to trigger a new deployment for the change to take effect.

2.  **Check the Browser Console**: Your browser's developer tools are your best friend.
    -   Right-click on the blank page and select "Inspect".
    -   Go to the "Console" tab.
    -   Look for any errors in red. These messages will often tell you exactly what's wrong (e.g., "API_KEY is not defined," "Failed to load resource," etc.).

3.  **Verify Build Settings**:
    -   Ensure your hosting provider is running the correct build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
    -   Make sure the "Publish directory" or "Output directory" is set correctly (usually `dist` or `build`).
